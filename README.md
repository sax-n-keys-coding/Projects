# Projects

Thank you for looking at a few examples of my work.
Some projects I've done for fun on the side with my studies.

Some of them are certainly simple, and I don't deny that.

I'm training myself to become independent with programming skills. Since I first made the repository, I've come a long way in UC Berkeley's CS 61B, implementign complex Java programs that demonstrate my ability to use optimal data structures and efficient algorithms. I plan to soon build larger-scale applications, software that I hope will be beneficial to its clients. 

If you have any feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know â€” I'm always looking to improve my understanding of coding and better my code.

I really appreciate it. Have a good day.
