# Projects

Thank you for looking at a few examples of my work.
Some projects I've done for fun on the side with my studies.

Some of them are certainly simple, and I don't deny that.

However, I'm training myself to gain basic independent programming skills.

If you have any feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know â€” I'm always looking to improve my understanding of coding and better my code.

I appreciate it.
